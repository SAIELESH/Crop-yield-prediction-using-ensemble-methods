# Crop-yield-prediction-using-ensemble-methods
In this project, we have utilized machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble algorithms to predict crop yield.
This is my practicum/thesis for a master's in artificial intelligence degree.
In this, we have incorporated various data sets to predict crop yield.
We have utilized datasets of soil details, weather, corn yield, and planting progress data that have been gathered from the web soil survey, Iowa Mesonet, NASA Power, and USDA NASS.
We have created a new model for predicting crop yield which has LGBM and HBGBR as base models and linear regression as meta-model. This proved to be better than traditional models like random forest and optimized ensemble techniques.
